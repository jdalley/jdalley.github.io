      <description>Oh, hi! I write things; mostly words, and sometimes in programming languages.
I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about programming, new tech, web culture, and helping people. I spend a lot of my free pouring over what&amp;rsquo;s new in the industry, and the community surrounding it. If I&amp;rsquo;m not doing that you&amp;rsquo;ll find me gaming, reading fantasy novels, drinking craft beer, or hanging out with my wife and dog.
This site will serve as a mix of musings on programming for sure, but also a collection of things I think are cool and choose to noodle on.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;tap tap&amp;hellip; is this thing on?
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to start writing when you&amp;rsquo;re staring at a blank page. My mind begins by trying to categorize all the types of posts I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about writing, but quickly blanks out. Having just watched myself write that, I think the next logical step is to not press backspace, and just keep going. So let&amp;rsquo;s do that.
Hmm what to write&amp;hellip; what to write&amp;hellip; well I guess I can start by enumerating a list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about writing, right?</description>
