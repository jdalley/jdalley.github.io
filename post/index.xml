      <description>&amp;hellip;tap tap&amp;hellip; is this thing on?
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to start writing when you&amp;rsquo;re staring at a blank page. My mind begins by trying to categorize all the types of posts I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about writing, but quickly blanks out. Having just watched myself write that, I think the next logical step is to not press backspace, and just keep going. So let&amp;rsquo;s do that.
Hmm what to write&amp;hellip; what to write&amp;hellip; well I guess I can start by enumerating a list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about writing, right?</description>
